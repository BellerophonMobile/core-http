CORE HTTP Daemon
================

This is an initial prototype for a RESTful [CORE][1] API.  See the
[ideas][2] document for motivation/thoughts.

The implementation is very rough right now, and currently supports limited
creating of sessions and objects.

Requirements
------------

* CORE should be installed to a location on PYTHONPATH
* Requires [CherryPy][3] 3.2 (tested with 3.2.2)
* Tested with Python 2.7.3
* Download [Ext JS][4] (tested with version 4.1.1) and put in "static/extjs".
    * I didn't want to commit all of extjs while developing (over 200MB), I'll
      probably add only the required extjs files when the UI gets closer to
      being ready.
* Download [mxGraph][5] and put in "static/mxgraph".
    * Recommended to just clone "git://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph.git" (from [6])
    * Same reasoning as ExtJS, I'll probably commit parts of this when the UI
      gets closer to being ready.
